    In honour of the late <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Engelbart">Douglas Engelbart</a>, this is but a tiny contribution to the set of Mind-Amplifying Tools he once visioned.
    We used Concept maps as a studying technique back at University, and have been fond of them ever since.
    However, we have not been able to find any satisfactory tools for drawing them, which should be easy, simple yet flexible, and fast.
    Silly-maps is hereby created first and foremost to suit our own needs. But if you happen to find it useful too, that's just awesome!

    Concept maps are great for both communicating and studying complex topics.
    In our humble opinion they should be used much more.
    Everything is connected, networks and associations between abstract or concrete things are everywhere.
    Here is a great video which explains this:

    Concept maps are scientifically proved to be an effective learning aid. For more information, there is always
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_maps">Wikipedia</a>, and for a deeper
    understanding here is the <a href="http://cmap.ihmc.us/publications/researchpapers/theorycmaps/theoryunderlyingconceptmaps.htm">
    theoretical foundations</a> for it.

    Silly-maps is open source and can be found at <a href="http://github.com/kmork/mat">GitHub</a>.
    It is running on the Amazon cloud, where the application is hosted by Heroku (Salesforce), and the data is provided by MongoHQ.
    Use it at your own risk. No guarantee for either uptime availability or possible data loss is hereby given.
    If you are paranoid, you could always save a static copy of your maps locally. It is plain HTML5 using SVG for drawing.

    Why the silly in silly-maps? First of all, there is no right or wrong when creating these maps.
    It is mostly just mapping a fragment of your own mind onto paper...ehh the computer screen, and our mind is pretty silly.
    Secondly, and most importantly - the domain name was available!
